The repository is for my statistical learning class project. It will contain code to generate the datasets, and then apply several machine learning algorithms to it.

## The Data

### Supreme Court Database
The first data set that I will be using for this project is [The Supreme court Database](http://supremecourtdatabase.org/index.php). They provide several different formats of the data for download but what I really need is the data in an relational database.

### Argument Transcripts
TODO: Make a database of argument transcripts.

### Opininons
TODO: Make a database of opinions.

## Algorithms
I will eventually attempt to use this data to train machine learning algorithms to automatically summarize the opinions, among other things as data completeness and time permit.
